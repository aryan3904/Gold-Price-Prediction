# 📈 Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the price of gold using machine learning models.  
It is part of my Machine Learning portfolio to demonstrate skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.
