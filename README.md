# 📈 Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the price of gold using machine learning models and includes a Streamlit web application for real-time predictions. It demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and web application development.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset is included in this repository as **`gold_price_data.csv`**.  
- Features:
  - `SPX` (S&P 500 Index)
  - `USO` (Crude Oil Price)
  - `SLV` (Silver Price)
  - `EUR/USD` (Currency Exchange Rate)
- Target:
  - `GLD` (Gold Price)

---

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Importing Libraries & Dataset
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Selection
5. Model Training (Linear Regression)
6. Model Evaluation
7. Visualization of Results
8. Conclusion

---

## 📊 Visualizations
- 📈 Gold Price Trend over Time  
- 🔥 Correlation Heatmap  
- 📉 Actual vs Predicted Gold Prices (Line Plot)  
- 🟣 Scatter Plot for Performance  

---

## 🌐 Streamlit Web Application
To run the web application:
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook to train and save the model:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Gold Price Prediction.ipynb"
   ```
   Make sure to run all cells to generate the model file (`gold_price_model.pkl`).

3. Launch the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

---

## 🚀 Results
- The Linear Regression model achieved:  
  **R² Score = 0.9894**  
- Predictions closely follow actual gold price trends, indicating strong performance.  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Use advanced ML/DL models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTMs).  
- Add macroeconomic indicators (inflation, interest rates, etc.) for better accuracy.  
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning.  

---

## 📌 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Streamlit
